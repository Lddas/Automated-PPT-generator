# Automated PPT Generator

## Overview

The Automated PPT Generator is a Python-based application designed to generate customized PowerPoint presentations based on user inputs. This tool is tailored for creating presentations related to specific content, including event details, hotel selections, and other relevant information.

Features

	•	Dynamic Input Fields: Users can input various event details, such as client name, event type, dates, and hotel selections.
	•	File Management: The tool handles various data formats and integrates them into a cohesive presentation.
	•	Customization Options: Users can adapt the generated presentations based on their specific needs.

Personalization

This project is specifically personalized to fit certain PowerPoint templates that cannot be publicly shared due to proprietary restrictions. However, the code itself is entirely developed by me and can serve as a foundation for other presentations. With minor modifications, this tool can be adapted to work with other PowerPoint templates as well.
